### Setup

My local environment is python-3.5.0.  Older python versions will not work.

Setup the source code

```
git clone https://github.com/snowch/demo_2710
cd demo_2710/web_app
source venv/bin/activate
```

Configure Cloudant and Redis

 - Create a Cloudant and Redis service in Bluemix.
 - Create the file etc/cloudant_vcap.json (see cloudant_vcap.json_template)

Setup the databases

```
./run.sh db_all
```

Run locally

```
./run.sh
```

Push to bluemix

 - edit manifest.yml
   - provide a unique host
   - change the name of the services to reflect
     - your cloudant service name
     - your redis service name

Then run

```
cf login ...
cf push
```
